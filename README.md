## Introduction

Understanding the movement and properties of celestial objects is essential in astronomy. In this project, we analyze star data to calculate the redshift and velocity of different stars based on their spectra. The code is written in MATLAB/Octave and involves various tasks to extract and visualize the data.

## Data

The star data is loaded from the `starData` file, which contains information about different stars' spectra and related measurements. The data should be in a specific format to ensure the code executes correctly. Please ensure that the `starData` file is present and structured correctly before running the code.

## Tasks

The main tasks performed in this project are as follows:

1. Loading the star data and defining measurement parameters.
2. Calculating the redshift and velocity for each star based on the hydrogen alpha line.
3. Plotting the spectra of different stars and highlighting stars with negative velocities.
4. Displaying the names of stars with positive velocities, indicating they are moving away from us.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following:

- MATLAB or Octave installed on your system.
- The `starData` file containing the required star data.
- Basic knowledge of MATLAB/Octave programming.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FISTDEMON/stellar-motion.git
```
